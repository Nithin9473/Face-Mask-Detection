Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that mimics the working ofhuman brain in processing data. It is used for detecting objects, 
recognizing speech, translating languages and making decisions. In this project we use Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), which is a popular algorithm used for image classification and Object Detection. 
Our system consists of a Dual Stage Convolution Neural Networks which is used for detecting the differentiation between masked and unmasked faces. 
This system is then integrated with pre-installed CCTV cameras.
This system therefore can be installed at public places like schools, colleges, Airports, Railway Stations, Shopping malls. 
This ensures the safety of the people and thus stops the transmission of virus from one person to the other to a great extent.
